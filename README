Hello!  Welcome to the documentation for GDICE using AWS.

Docker 1:
This just creates a container that has the adt environment installed.  Just run the docker file.  The installation is modified from the base build to be lighter.

Docker 2:
This is what actually builds the evaluator for GDICE.  This file can be fairly confusing so make sure to read this document!

TOP FILE---------------------------------------------
compete_fastdice.py-
This file grabs the aws files we need as well as the agents and begins the simulation.

GraphPolicyController.py/GraphNode.py/discretesample.py-
All of these files make up G-Dice's nodes and a system to control those nodes.

sample_test.py-
This is just the runner.  Feel free to ignore this.

Dockerfile/trialrun.sh/pipinstall.sh-
These all help the docker installation.

SIM CODE-------------------------------------------------
GraphPolicyController.py/GraphNode.py/discretesample.py-
All of these files make up G-Dice's nodes and a system to control those nodes.

fastcube.py-
The actual agent that is running GDICE.

constant.py-
Important constants.

GDiceController.py-
This folder allows our system to actually translate our GDICE nodes into actions.

fastcube_files----------------------
This section contains all of the TMA's and their dependent files.
